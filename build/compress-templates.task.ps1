# 
# COMPRESS TEMPLATES
#
# This task should be run prior to publishing the project as a nuget package. In addition to 
# lowering the file size, this is specifically used to prevent a bug that is caused by URI
# encoding of the file names during publishing.
#
# If you have a templatized file name .ts it will be encoded to %24(%24Model.Name.KebabCase).ts
